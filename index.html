		<h3> About </h3>
		<p> This is a game based on Conway's Game of Life. 
		</p>
		
		<div class="board">

		<h3> Rules </h3>
		<p> Cells that have 2 or 3 neighbors survive (and remain the same color). Cells with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors die due to under- or over-population, respectively. Empty locations (black) that have exactly 3 neighbors reproduce a daughter cell that is the color of the majority (red or blue) in that location's neighborhood.
